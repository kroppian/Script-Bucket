# Script-Bucket

A lot of what I code are small scripts that help me out in my daily life. It's a great way to casually learn a language and make mundane tasks easier. However, often times I find myself relearning how to do tasks that I did a few days ago. So I record scripts that I've written in the past so I can look back on them in reference and learn from the day to day coding that I create. 
In short, whenever I make a script to automate a little task, I throw it in the bucket for further reference. 

Feedback is strongly encouraged! I want to know how YOU (the reader) would do the same task.
